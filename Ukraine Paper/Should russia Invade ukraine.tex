% why is a negotiated settlement unlikely 
% - the conflict is currently active, "Forcing a settlement under these conditions is likely to backfire, with far-reaching consequences for international security."

% -"The idea that a compromise can be struck with Putin is a dangerous fantasy... There is no division of Ukrainian territory or set of security policies that can address the underlying causes of the war and foster a sustainable peace."

% how is this ethno nationalist conflict?

%  - Leading figures in Putin’s inner circle regularly call Ukrainians (once supposed to be in no way different from Russians) dehumanizing names such as “cockroaches,” “lice,” “rabid mongrels . . . choking on their toxic saliva,” a “hated Nazi tumor,” “nonhumans,” “evil spirits,” and “bloody possessed satanists” in need of extermination. An ex-leader of the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic told Ukrainians via Russian state television: “We will kill as many of you as we have to. We will kill one million, or five million; we can exterminate all of you until you understand that you’re possessed and you have to be cured.”

% - active warcrimes and genocide

% - "The April 2022 discoveries in Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin, and Mariupol of mass graves of Ukrainian civilians who had been bound, tortured, and executed was a sign that Russia’s anger at early failures was being redirected against noncombatants singled out for their nationality."

% - twenty-thousand Ukrainian children have been forcibly abducted and sent to orphanages, foster homes, or adoptive families in Russia. There they are subjected to harsh indoctrination and reeducation programs that seek to erase their Ukrainian identity. 

% - Lest anyone doubt the sincerity of Putin’s campaign to erase future generations of Ukrainians, one only need to look at the deadly bombings of Ukrainian maternity and children’s hospitals throughout the war, far from the front lines and any military targets.

% -Whatever Moscow’s original aims, the conflict is now an ethnonational struggle, a war of peoples. 

% -It would not be easy for Russia to walk away from the ethnic war it has engineered, either. Putin understands a truth known to generations of statesmen before him: Nationalism is a powerful motivator in war and the lynchpin of the mass army in modern warfare.11 As economic conditions worsen in Russia and more Russian soldiers come home maimed and disabled (if they return at all), Putin becomes ever more dependent on a radically nationalistic ideology to fill the ranks, justify his war, and legitimize his rule

% -No wonder that civil wars in ethnically polarized societies have been found to last longer than less polarized societies: Wars over identity, once unleashed, are nearly impossible to return to Pandora’s box.12 Each side has spilled too much blood in the name of identity to easily walk back from the brink, let alone negotiate a just and durable peace between societies infused with nationalist animus for the other. No peace treaty — not least one forced on Ukraine under international pressure — can induce compromise when a people’s existence hangs in the balance.
